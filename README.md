# Data Component Use Case for Overland Flow Simulation
[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/gantian127/overlandflow_usecase/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

This repository includes a [Jupyter Notebook](overland_flow.ipynb) which demonstrates how to use 
the [CSDMS Data Component](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/DataComponents) to download the topography dataset 
and use the [Landlab](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/) components 
to delineate the watershed and simulate the overland flow for a study area in the Boulder County.

This Jupyter Notebook is part of the work for a research paper
"CSDMS Data Components: data-model integration tools for Earth surface processes modeling".
